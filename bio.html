            <h1 id="bio-title"><b>Who am I?</b></h1>
            <p>Currently located in London, I am a Brazilian-Finn who is passionate about blockchain technology and social impact initiatives. I am the co-founder of the largest open blockchain education platform in Brazil, BlockchainBH, 
                and have worked as an educator, developer and lecturer in the field. 
                Coming from a Business Management background, I am currently an Ethereum developer and have some additional experience with web and backend. 
                As of right now, I hold a position as a Visiting Scholar at IGTI, where I helped develop the first blockchain-focused MBA in Brazil, 
                as well as work as a Project Lead at London Blockchain Labs. Outside of tech, my interests include Writing, Design, Photography, Hiking and Calisthenics.
                I speak four languages, tell stories like a Brazilian, and withstand cold like a Finn. I am a go-getter who learned how to code, design, do financial accounting, 
                pitch and lead in order to be able to get projects off the ground with minimal help.
             On that note, every line of text, code and every picture on this website is my own (except for the one on this page). Enjoy.  </p>
